Unit tests are going to be my best friend here.

I would like a queuing mechanism that allows me to vote on a cateogry for a thing it doesn't recognize.  I want it to learn over time.

I would like some reporting functionality to show me heat maps month over month.

I would like a way to maintain the categories.
