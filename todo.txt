I would like a way to maintain the categories.

I would like to be able to run a make command to encrypt the database to be checked into git.  

When selecting a new category, it should also update it in the learning table so new charges get auto-reassigned as well.

Month break out page for sorting by highest to lowest charges.

Dont pull categories you never care about (cc payment for example).
