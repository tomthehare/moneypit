I would like a way to maintain the categories outside of the script.

We need a page to drag and drop CSVs to be ingested.  Should load the data, then present a new page to get them assigned to categories.

I would like to be able to run a make command to encrypt the database to be checked into git.  

When selecting a new category, it should also update it in the learning table so new charges get auto-reassigned as well.

Month break out page for sorting by highest to lowest charges.
