I would like to be able to run a make command to encrypt the database to be checked into git.

When selecting a new category, it should also update it in the learning table so new charges get auto-reassigned as well.

Month break out page for sorting by highest to lowest charges.

Fix bug where it shows amazon when the category doesnt get auto matched

It's "working" - I think we might need to just need to do an inprocess check to see if a given [denom, memo, source, date]
tuple exists in db or not.  A unique constraint exists, but it's including filename which did change.  This will happen again.

Show the latest date on file for each category so we can grab new data.

Show a report with mortgage, childcare, etc. removed for visualization purposes
