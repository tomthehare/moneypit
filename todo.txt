I would like to be able to run a make command to encrypt the database to be checked into git.

Month break out page for sorting by highest to lowest charges.

Fix bug where it shows amazon when the category doesnt get auto matched

It's "working" - I think we might need to just need to do an inprocess check to see if a given [denom, memo, source, date]
tuple exists in db or not.  A unique constraint exists, but it's including filename which did change.  This will happen again.

I would like to have a page that allows me to reassign the learned categories to a new category.
Maybe also a way to find all transactions with a given category string and category to modify?
